# DeepLSH: Deep Locality-Sensitive Hash Learning for Fast Near Duplicate Crash Report Detection

## Overview
In this work, we aim at detecting for a crash report its candidate near-duplicates (i.e., similar crashes that are likely to be induced by the same software bug) in a large database of historical crashes and given any similarity measure dedicated to compare between stack traces. To this end, we propose **DeepLSH**: a deep Siamese hash coding neural network that learns to approximate the locality-sensitive property to provide binary hash codes aiming to locate the most similar stack traces into hash buckets.
